## Overview

This R package creates tree widgets using the JavaScript library [jsTree](https://github.com/vakata/jstree), e.g., in Shiny. The [jsTree](https://github.com/vakata/jstree) library has been included. shinytree is built on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and supports [jQuery.NiceScroll](https://github.com/inuyaksa/jquery.nicescroll). Please be aware that this R package is a more lightweight alternative to [shinyTree](https://github.com/shinyTree/shinyTree) and thus does not implement methods to create or convert trees or tree-like structures.

If `search` is added as a plugin, two additional functions are automatically activated: one button to select search results; another one to reset the tree, i.e., collapse all opened leaves and remove a currently active search.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinytree from [GitHub](https://github.com/stefanieschneider/shinytree):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stefanieschneider/shinytree")
```

## Usage

```{r example, code = readLines("inst/examples/tree.R")}
```
